# Sushi-Game

_The final assignment for COMP 401 - Fundamentals of Programming. The task included taking a bare user interface (Assignment 9 Inititial Start File.jar) and adding increased functionality to both the GUI using JSwing as well as internal functionality of the logic using Java to come to a final game/simulation (Runnable Assignment 9.jar)._

Concepts used:
* MVC
* OOP
* Observer/Observable
* Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Other common programming fundamentals

Instructions:
* Both .jar files are runnable, one shows the inital task, the other my final, altered submission.
* The game simulates a sushi conveyor belt and allows the player to add plates of certain colors and content to the belt as well as rotate the belt.
* AI users will remove/eat sushi as the player rotates the belt
